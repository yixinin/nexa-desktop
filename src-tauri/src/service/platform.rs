//! Registration of the system service, per platform.
//!
//! Two very different mechanisms live behind one API:
//!
//! * **Windows** — the desktop app runs as the invoking user (`asInvoker` manifest), so the
//!   `sc.exe` calls are written into a batch file and that batch file is re-launched through the
//!   UAC prompt (`Start-Process -Verb RunAs`). Elevating `sc.exe` rather than this binary keeps
//!   the GUI out of the privileged path — nothing depends on our own argument parsing surviving
//!   the round trip — and the batch file redirects `sc.exe`'s real error text into a log we read
//!   back, so a failure is reported instead of being flattened into "access denied".
//! * **Unix** — there is no equivalent of a batch file, and the unit file / plist has to be
//!   written by *this* process, so the whole operation re-launches the current executable
//!   elevated (`service::elevate`) and reports its outcome through a result file.
