//! The error contract shared by every Tauri command and by the service IPC channel.
//!
//! The UI ships in English and Simplified Chinese, so Rust must not hand the frontend prose to
//! display. Every failure is instead described by a stable code from [`codes`], which the
//! frontend resolves against `src/api/errors.ts` / the locale files (`error.<code>`), plus an
//! optional `detail` holding the raw diagnostic (an OS error, a service-manager stderr dump,
//! ...). `detail` is English by convention, is never localized, and is meant for the log and for
//! a collapsed "technical details" disclosure — never for the headline message.
//!
//! Adding a code is a two-sided change: declare it here **and** teach the frontend about it
//! (`src/api/errors.ts` message keys). A code must never be renamed silently: it is part of the
//! wire format between the UI, the service daemon, and a previously installed service binary.
