 * status change after the fact.
 *
 * The two orthogonal concerns are kept apart and named explicitly:
 *   - **execution backend** (`config.useService`): in-process, or the installed system service
 *   - **forwarding mode** (`config.useTun`): TUN, or the local proxy
 *
 * TUN is gated on the service being installed (§5.12): without it the app runs the local proxy,
