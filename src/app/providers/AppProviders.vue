/**
 * Cross-cutting overlay host (§3.2).
 *
 * Everything that has to render *above* the shell lives here, once: the confirm dialog, the toast
 * host and the right-click menu. All three are driven by module singletons (`useConfirm`,
 * `useToast`, `useContextMenu`) rather than by props threaded down from the root, which is what
 * previously left `ConfirmDialog.vue` rendered but unopenable — nothing ever set its `visible`
 * flag (D2).
 *
 * Theme, locale and platform are not provided here: they are module-level state resolved in
 * `main.ts` before the first paint, so there is nothing left to inject by the time this component
 * mounts.
