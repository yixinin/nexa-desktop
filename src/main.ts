/**
 * Application entry (§3.2, §5.4, §5.11 rule 1).
 *
 * Order is the whole point of this file:
 *
 *   1. styles, in dependency order — raw tokens, then the semantic theme mapping, then the reset
 *   2. the theme attribute, *before* mount, so the first paint is already the right theme and no
 *      white flash happens on a dark-mode machine (§5.4)
 *   3. the platform flag, also before mount: the shell decides whether to draw its own window
 *      controls from it, and resolving it after mount would show Linux users a set of buttons that
 *      then disappear
 *   4. `<html lang>` and the document title from the resolved locale (D14)
 *   5. mount
 *
 * Runtime proxy state is deliberately last and not awaited: it needs the backend, and the shell
 * renders `stopped` until the first status arrives.
